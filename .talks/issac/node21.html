The space of decimal expansions
</H1>

<P>
In analysis one is interested in
approximation processes (limits) and functions that preserve the
approximation processes (continuous functions).  A topology on a set
consists of structure that allows one to define approximation
processes in the set. For example, such a structure on the real
numbers is induced by the usual notion of distance.

<P>
In this chapter we are interested in a topological structure on the
set of decimal expansions of real numbers, and its relation to the
topological structure on the set of real numbers. Notice the
distinction; a decimal expansion is a concrete syntactic entity (a
sequence of digits), but a real number is an abstract mathematical
entity.

<P>
To motivate this, consider a program that runs forever, printing the
decimal expansion of&nbsp;10#10.
At any stage of the computation, only a
finite prefix of the decimal expansion will be observed. However, a
prefix as long as we are patient to wait for will be observed.
Moreover, the collection of all such (finite) prefixes uniquely
determines the entire (infinite) decimal expansion.  Thus, the
computation can be thought as a sequence of approximations that
converges to the entire decimal expansion.

<P>
Now consider a program that runs forever, sometimes reading decimal
digits from the input, and sometimes printing decimal digits to the
output, so that a function on decimal expansions is implemented. As
before, both the input and the output are infinite.
However, it is clear that finite amounts of output digits can depend
only on finite amounts of input digits. In this sense, the program
respects the approximation process describe above and hence is
continuous with respect to this notion of approximation.

<P>
All this can be made mathematically precise in various ways. For
instance, one can define a notion of distance between decimal
expansions. For simplicity, we shall consider only fractional infinite
decimal expansions in these notes; we therefore ignore the decimal
point and the leading digit zero, so that a decimal expansion is just
a sequence of decimal digits.  We can say, for example, that the
distance between two distinct expansions 11#11
and 12#12
is
2<SUP>-<I>n</I></SUP> where <I>n</I> is the first position at which they
differ--admittedly, the number 2<SUP>-<I>n</I></SUP> is rather arbitrary, and other
choices such as 1/<I>n</I> work equally well. With this, continuity in the
above sense is formalized by the usual 
<!-- MATH: $\epsilon-\delta$ -->
13#13
definition
that occurs in real analysis.  In this way, the decimal expansions are
made into a metric space.

<P>
If we abstract from the metric, whose numerical details are for the
most part irrelevant, one gets a topological space. Let 
<!-- MATH: $\alpha
\equiv_n \beta$ -->
14#14
mean that the distance between&nbsp;11#11
and 12#12
is
smaller than 2<SUP>-<I>n</I></SUP>, that is, that 
<!-- MATH: $\alpha_i = \beta_i$ -->
15#15
for all <I>i</I> &lt;
<I>n</I>. Then a set <I>U</I> of decimal expansions is open with respect to this
notion of distance iff whenever 
<!-- MATH: $\alpha \in U$ -->
16#16
there is an <I>n</I> such
that 
<!-- MATH: $\beta \in U$ -->
17#17
for all 
<!-- MATH: $\beta \equiv_n \alpha$ -->
18#18.
A sequence
19#19
of decimal expansions converges to a decimal
expansion&nbsp;12#12
iff for every open set&nbsp;<I>U</I> with 
<!-- MATH: $\beta \in U$ -->
17#17,
as
small as we please, there is an <I>n</I> such that 
<!-- MATH: $\alpha_i \in U$ -->
20#20
for all
21#21.
A function&nbsp;22#22
of decimal expansions is continuous with
respect to this topology iff for every&nbsp;11#11
and every <I>n</I> there is
a&nbsp;<I>k</I> such that 
<!-- MATH: $\alpha \equiv_k \beta$ -->
23#23
implies 
<!-- MATH: $\phi(\alpha) \equiv_n
\phi(\beta)$ -->
24#24
for all&nbsp;12#12.
The reader who is familiar with topology may have noticed that this
way of topologizing decimal expansions is equivalent to endowing the
digit set 
<!-- MATH: $D= \{ 0,1,\dots,9 \}$ -->
25#25
with the discrete topology and
then the set 
<!-- MATH: $D^{\mathbb{N}}$ -->
26#26
of decimal expansions with the product
topology.

<P>
In the following chapters we use topological arguments to prove
computational propositions.  Unfortunately, we cannot include all the
background details here, so refer the interested reader to
Smyth&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node38.html#smyth:topology">54</A>] and Vickers&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node38.html#vickers:topology">57</A>] for
introductions to topology for computer scientists.
