Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
We introduce real number computation with digital computers, as
formalized by Turing machines, from both practical and theoretical
perspectives.  In the computational models that we consider, real
number computations can be performed to any desired degree of
accuracy.

<P>
An important property of the models is that the programmer doesn't
need to be concerned with the syntactical details of the notation
systems for real numbers in order to develop mathematically correct
programs.  As far as the programmer is concerned, real numbers are
taken in the usual (classical) mathematical sense. Of course, in any
approach to real number computation, there must be an underlying
machinery (called the operational semantics) for computing a
syntactical representative of the mathematical entity denoted by a
program (called the semantical denotation).  The perfect match of the
operational and the denotational semantics is called computational
adequacy. This is what ensures that the programmer can ignore the
operational semantics, relying only on algebraic and analytic methods,
in order to derive mathematically correct programs.

<P>
Two topics, computability and complexity, are not developed in this
introductory account--see Pour-el and
Richards&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node38.html#pour-el:richards">48</A>], Weihrauch&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node38.html#weihrauch:2000">64</A>] and
Ko&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node38.html#keriko">35</A>] among other references--but the fundamental
properties of the notion of computability are included.  Computability
theory is concerned with the classification of mathematical entities
as either computable or not computable, and complexity theory is
concerned with the classification of computable mathematical entities
in degrees of consumption of computational resources--space and time.
No doubt, these two topics are not only of fundamental importance but
also of interest in their own right. In these notes, however, we wish
to emphasize the connections between operational and denotational
aspects of real number computation.

<P>
Another omission is the well-known BSS model of real number
computation of Blum, Shub and
Smale&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node38.html#blum:shub:smale:article">10</A>,<A
 HREF="node38.html#MR99a:68070">9</A>]. In our view, this is
best regarded as a mathematical abstraction of floating-point
computation.  What we study here, however, is an alternative approach
to real number computation proposed by Turing in 1937, with ideas
going back to Brouwer in 1920. 

<P>
With recent technological advances on digital computers, which have
dramatically increased their speed and their storage capabilities, the
theoretical ideas of Brouwer and Turing have been experimentally put
in practice.  Many (non-commercial) packages for exact real number
computation have been implemented in a variety of programming
languages.  A competition between systems for exact real computation
is being organized by David Lester as part of the fourth workshop on
<EM>Computability and Complexity in Analysis</EM> in Swansea, Wales in
September--see
