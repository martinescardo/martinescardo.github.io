Ok, the above is fine, but how about functions such as 1/<I>x</I>?  One
could of course truncate the infinite numeral representing a number
such as 1/3 to a finite large numeral, but then the above
problems would be reintroduced.  In our last, and successful, attempt,
we use potentially <EM>infinite</EM> sequences of signed digits, rather
than <EM>arbitrary large</EM> sequences. Because our previous algorithms
process digit sequences from left to right, it turns out that they
already work in this more general setting.

<P>
This is inefficient, compared to floating-point computation, but
works. All sorts of improvements
(empirically and/or theoretically justified) have been proposed, with
good gains in performance, sometimes with more than one order of
magnitude, for both time and space.  But, despite these advances and
unforeseen advances, one is most likely to continue using
floating-point approximations and live with round-off errors
<EM>when this is possible</EM>.

<P>
The point is, however, as the logistic map illustrates, that sometimes
floating-point computations don't produce correct answers.  In this
case, as inefficient as it can be, exact numerical computation is of
help. Of course, one can sometimes use symbolic methods, and this is
the whole point of computer algebra. But it is often the case that
computer algebra gives a symbolic solution to a problem, which then
has to be numerically evaluated for some values of the variables.
Then, even if the symbolic solution is mathematically correct, one
tends to have little confidence on the numerical solution. It is very
likely that computer algebra systems will include engines for exact
numerical evaluation of symbolic expressions in the near future.

<P>
As we mentioned in the introduction, many (non-commercial) packages
for exact real number computation have been implemented in a variety
of programming languages.  In particular, David Plume&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node38.html#plume">46</A>]
implemented a framework for exact real number computation as his BSc
honour project in the functional programming languages Haskell. His
project report, which is available from my home page, is a
well-written introductory account to some technical aspects of the
subject.
