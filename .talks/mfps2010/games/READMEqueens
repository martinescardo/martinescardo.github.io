For n = 13 (1.7 Ghz machine) 
An optimal play is [0,2,4,1,8,11,9,12,3,5,7,10,6] 
and the optimal outcome is True

For n = 14 (2.1 Ghz machine):
An optimal play is [0,2,4,6,11,9,12,3,13,8,1,5,7,10] 
and the optimal outcome is True

Notice that 14 ! = 87 178 291 200.
Hence if all permutations had been checked (which they were not),
then 15 761 759 permutations per second would have been checked. 

This is interesting, because our algorithm doesn't include explicit
euristics to cut down the number of permutations checked.

Notice that the time ratio between these two experiments is ~ 10.
It should be in theory 14 in the worst case. 

For n = 15, I estimate that, 23 hours (15 * the above time) would be
needed to compute a solution in the worst case (and at least 15 hours
if we are lucky as above).
