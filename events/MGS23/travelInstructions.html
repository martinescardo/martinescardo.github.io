It is <b>strongly recommended</b> to buy tickets in advance, because the machines will be crowded.  Go to the <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/">National Rail</a> website, and ask for a return ticket from Birmingham to University (Birmingham) on Monday, departing at 08:00 and returning at 19:00.   Press "Go" then select an <b>Anytime Day Return</b> ticket for &pound;3.20.  (The time you select is irrelevant; the ticket may be used at any time.)   Buy the ticket, specifying Birmingham New Street as the collection place, and do the same for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  You will be given codes that you can enter into a machine at New Street on Sunday to collect your tickets.  Be sure to have with you the card you used to buy the tickets. <p>

To go from the University station to morning lectures, exit "University" station, turn left, cross the road, enter the <b>Learning Centre</b>, and UG09 is the second room on the right.  Coffee breaks are in the School of Computer Science, directly opposite the Learning Centre.  Here is a <a href="Department.png">map</a> of the relevant area; Computer Science is marked "Y9", the Learning Centre "R28".
