<h1>Travel Instructions</h1>
<h2> From Birmingham Airport to Birmingham New Street Railway Station
</h2>
Birmingham Airport has a train station called Birmingham
International, which is linked to the airport by a unmanned train
system called AirRailLink. This should be signposted in the
airport. From Birmingham International there are frequent trains to
Birmingham New Street.
<h2> From Birmingham New Street Railway Station to the ETAP-hotel
</h2>
When you enter the main concourse of Birmingham New Street station,
turn left. Pass the WH Smiths and M&S-shops and exit the concourse and
reach a driveway. Follow the driveway
until you reach a set of traffic lights. Cross the main road, which is
called Smallbrook Queensway, and turn right.
Walk along Smallbrook Queensway until you reach a large roundabout. Turn left at this roundabout into Bristol Street (the
A38). Walk along Bristol Street for about 300m until you reach an
underpass at the junction of Bristol Street and Bromsgrove
Street. The 
ETAP-hotel is now on the other side of Bristol Street, so just take the
underpass to end up very close to the entrance of the hotel. A map of
the surrounding area may be found <a

here. </a> <P>
There is also a taxi rank at New Street Station. Taxis to the
ETAP-hotel will cost about 5 pounds.



<h2> From the ETAP-hotel to the University </h2>
The best way is to use a bus.  If you leave the hotel, cross Bristol Road (the big
dual carriageway) via the underpass. Turn right on the other side of
the underpass and walk along Bristol Road until you reach the next bus
stop.  The numbers 61, 62 and 63 are all equally useful. Take any of
these ones and stay on the bus for about 15 mins until you reach a
pub on the right, called  the Gunbarrel Pub. Next you pass a gate
which leads to the University on your right hand side  and shortly
afterwards a Tesco Express combined with a petrol station. Leave the
bus at the next bus stop after the petrol station, which 
is called Dawlish Road. Now turn into Grange Road, 
which leaves Bristol Street at the Goose at the OVT pub on the other
side of the road. There are traffic lights behind the bus stop. Follow this
street via traffic light-controlled crossing of a man road into the
University campus using the Grange Road gate (on the bottom of the <a

University map). </a> <P>
To reach the School of Computer Science (Y9) and the Learning Centre
(H28), turn left at the first junction after entering the
University. Follow this road round a bend to the right until the main
road turns right again. Here you turn left. The Computer Science
building is to your left, and the Learning Centre is to your right.


<h2> From the University to the ETAP-hotel </h2>
Go back to Bristol Road. If you reach Bristol Road at the Goose at the OVT
turn left and walk along Bristol Road until you reach the next
bus stop. Take a 61, 62 or 63 bus towards the City Centre. Follow it
for about 15 minutes until you reach a big junction, where on the left
hand side before the junction there is a McDonalds and on the  
right-hand side after the junction there is a church followed by a Ford
garage. Leave the bus at the second stop after this junction. The
ETAP-hotel is on the left of the main road.
