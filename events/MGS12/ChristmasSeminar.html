<em>How computer science helps to bring quantum physics to the masses. </em> 
<br>
Bob Coecke, Oxford University
<BR>
<blockquote>
We present computational aspects of quantum theory in a computer science dress and show how this not only helps towards novel quantum technologies but also allows for a more intuitive presentation of the theory which doesn't require a background in mathematical physics.  In particular, the language that we will use closely resembles flowcharts.  We also illustrate how this research is transcendental with respect to disciplinary boundaries and has helped in solving problems in other areas, most notably, natural language processing.

<em>A Tutorial on Concurrent and Parallel Programming in Haskell
</em><BR>
<a href=http://cs.bham.ac.uk/~singhsu/> Satnam Singh </a>, University of Birmingham  <BR>
<blockquote>
This tutorial introduces practical aspects of writing concurrent and
data-parallel programs in the pure lazy functional programming language
Haskell. The focus will be about writing concurrent and parallel programs
for multi-core processors but alternative computing elements like GPUs
(graphic processing units) and FPGAs (Lego-like circuits) will also be
considered.

<em>  Can we make a decision?
</em><br>
Rick Thomas, University of Leicester <BR>
<blockquote>
The notion of decidability is a fundamental one in Computer Science.  In this talk we will discuss the decidability of certain questions with a particular emphasis on some problems in mathematics.  The talk will not assume any prior knowledge of decidability (or the problems from mathematics that we consider) and will take the form of a survey (as opposed to going into any technical details).
