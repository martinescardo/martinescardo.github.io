Restaurant Guide for MGS 2012
</center>
</h1>
You won't go hungry during MGS 2012 --- The Etap Hotel is next to
several entertainment centres in the City Centre and plenty of
restaurants are within easy walking distance. The following is just
some small selection.

<h2>Arcadian area</h2>
<p>This is the area near the <i>Birmingham Hippodrome</i>, where there
are quite a few reasonably priced eateries of various kinds. 
To get there, cross the Bristol Road via the pedestrian
tunnel, turn left along Bristol Road (towards the City Centre) and
take a right turn after about 150m into <i>Inge Street</i>. You are
now walking directly towards a pub, called
<i>The Old Fox</i>. The Arcadian square with quite a few restaurants
may be reached via a footpaths on the left of the Old Fox. </p>

The Arcadian is Birmingham's very own <i>China Town</i> with a
number of quite authentic places. Our Chinese colleagues tell us that
<ul><li>
  <B>Chung Ying Garden</B>, 17 Thorp Street, 0121 666 6622
</ul>
is the best of them all. It tends to be quite busy so phoning first
could be an idea but then, there are so many other places nearby that
you can be sure to find something. If you are on a small budget then try
<ul><li>
  <B>Big Wok</B>, 5 Wrottesley St, 0121 666 6800
</ul>
The <i>Arcadian Centre</i>, which gives the area its name, is a
conglomerate of eateries and bars, which are very popular with young
people (particularly on weekends). The
<ul><li>
 <B>Festival Balti</B>, 70 Hurst St, 0121 622 6289
</ul>
is a very civilized place and offers traditional Birmingham Asian
fare.

<h2>The Mailbox</h2>
This is the former Royal Mail sorting office and now houses
Birmingham's poshest shops. It is just 400m along Bristol Road towards
the City on your left hand side. However, because of the
<i>Holloway Circus</i> roundabout, I recommend that you take the
underpass to the other side of the road, go towards the Arcadian, (eg
by taking Thorp Street), then turn left onto Hurst Street and walk all
the way up to Navigation St. There take a left turn again and you will
be led <i>underneath</i> the busy Queensway (the continuation of
Bristol Road) directly towards the Mailbox. The restaurants are at the
far end of the building and we have found them all quite agreeable,
but pricier than what you have around the Arcadian.

<h2>Brindley Place</h2>
This is a mostly upmarket area for eating out. Colourful, busy, and
offering great choice of styles. To get there, follow the instructions
for the Mailbox but cross Navigation Street up the hill towards
Victoria Square (which is where the Town Hall is). Follow the stream
of people between Old Town Hall and the new one towards the Central
Library, which you can walk through towards Centenary Square and the
ICC/Symphony Hall beyond. Pass through the ICC and as you leave at the
western end you are facing the Brindley Place area. Take your pick. We
can recommend all of the following:
<ul><li>
  <B>Bank</B>, 4 Brindley Place, 0121 633 4466
</ul>
<ul><li>
  <B>Thai Edge</B>, 7 Oozells Square, 0121 643 3993
</ul>
<ul><li>
  <B>Tin Tin</B> Brindley Place, 0121 633 0888
</ul>
but there are many more. 

Although you are not very far from your hotel, it is probably easiest
to take a taxi home because the busy inner ring road cuts off the most
natural routes back to the Etap.

<h2>Near the University</h2>
As you leave the campus along Grange Road towards Bristol Road you
will actually come to a quite decent Italian place on the Bristol
Road. It's the
<ul><li>
  <B>Rimini</B>, 523--525 Bristol Road, 0121 472 4423
</ul>
Also note that there is a Tesco Express a little further along Bristol
Road towards the city. It is quite well stocked with groceries etc.
