<center><h2>Directions to Pasta di Piazza</h2></center>
<p>
The restaurant is <a href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/idld.srf?X=406407&Y=287450&Z=110">here</a> on a map.
</p><p>
The following directions are logically very simple,
but to get an overview of the route and work out how
to get to the restaurant after you leave the canal,
it would be a good idea to look at the map.
</p><p>
<h4>WALK FROM THE UNIVERSITY ALONG THE CANAL</h4>
Feasible if you leave promptly after the last lecture.
Go down the steps next to University Station
and carry on in the same direction, then:
</p><p>
<h4>WALK FROM FIVE WAYS STATION ALONG THE CANAL</h4>
Turn right out of the station and IMMEDIATELY
right again down the steps, then turn round
and go in the opposite direction from the steps.
</p><p>
Go straight on to the junction in the canal
at The Cube and The Mailbox.
</p><p>
Turn left and take one of the bridges across the canal.
Go to the three-way junction by the Malt House pub
and the O2 Arena.
</p><p>
Turn right (behind the pub) and go along the canal
as far as the steps at Newhall Street.
</p><p>
Turn left and carry on until the bend in the road.
</p><p>
Turn right into BROOK STREET. The restaurant is on the right.
</p><p>
<h4>FROM NEW STREET STATION</h4>
</p><p>
Leave the station using the exit next to Boots (pharmacy).
</p><p>
Go up the short street opposite to NEW STREET.
</p><p>
Turn left along New Street and then right up BENNETT'S HILL.
</p><p>
Cross the main road, directly across.  The street
is now called Newhall Street.
</p><p>
Carry on until the bend in the road,
</p><p>
Turn right into BROOK STREET. The restaurant is on the right.
