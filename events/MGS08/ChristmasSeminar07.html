<em>Static contract checking for Haskell. </em>

Simon Peyton Jones, Microsoft Research

Slides. </a> <BR>
<blockquote>
 Modern type systems (eg in Haskell and ML) exclude many bugs by
 construction.  But not all!  We would like to go beyond these
 type systems, and write down the pre and post-conditions of our
 functions.  More generally, in a higher-order language like
 Haskell, we extend traditional pre/post conditions to so-called
"contracts. 
<BR>
Then we are faced with questions like
    <UL>  
<LI>   What does it mean, precisely, for a function to 'satisfy a contract'?
<LI>   How can we statically verify that it satisfies the contract?
<LI>   What if the contract itself violates the contracts of the
        functions it calls?
</UL>
In my talk I'll describe work in progress that makes some progress on
these questions, in the context of Haskell.  Our goal is to extend the
"reach" of static verification, beyond traditional type systems, and
to do so in a way that ordinary programmers (without PhDs) can make
sense of.

<em>Geometry of Synthesis: A structured approach to VLSI design
</em><BR>
Dan Ghica, University of Birmingham <BR>

paper. </a>
<blockquote>
I propose a new technique for hardware synthesis from higher-order
functional languages with imperative features based on Reynolds's
Syntactic Control of Interference. The affine type system is useful
for managing the thorny issue of sharing in physical circuits. We use
a semantic model inspired by game semantics and the geometry of
interaction, and express it directly as a certain class of digital
circuits that form a cartesian, monoidal-closed category. Based on
this theoretical foundation we introduce a new ANSI C to hardware
compiler and we discuss some methodological issues regarding the role
of higher order programming languages in hardware design.

<em> Switched-on Yampa: Programming Modular Synthesizers in Haskell  </em><br>
Henrik Nilsson, University of Nottingham <BR>
<a href=switched-on-yampa.pdf> Slides </a>
<blockquote>
In this talk and demonstration, we present an implementation of a
modular synthesizer in Haskell using Yampa. A synthesizer, be it a
hardware instrument or a pure software implementation, as here, is said
to be modular if it provides sound-generating and sound-shaping
components that can be interconnected in arbitrary ways. Yampa, a
Haskell-embedded implementation of Functional Reactive Programming,
supports flexible construction of hybrid systems. Since music is a
hybrid continuous-time and discrete-time phenomenon, Yampa and is a
good fit for such applications, offering some unique possibilities
compared to most languages targeting music or audio applications. The
demonstration illustrates this point by showing how simple audio blocks
can be described and then interconnected in a network with dynamically
changing structure, reflecting the changing demands of a musical
performance.
