<h1>Access to the wireless network at MGS 2008 </h1>
You can contact in two ways to the wireless network:
<UL>
  <LI>
      <b> through eduroam: </B> If you are from a UK university which
      has enabled the eduroam - service by Janet, you may use your
      eduroam-credentials and log in to the wireless network with the
      essid "eduroam".
  </LI>
  <LI>
      <b> through the guest network: </B> if you are unable to use
      eduroam, you need an account on the wireless network with the
      essid "UOBGUEST". We have created these accounts if your home
      University is not connected to eduroam, and will distribute them
      during registration.
  </LI>
