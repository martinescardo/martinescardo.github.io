The <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/MGS">Midlands Graduate School (MGS)</a>
in the Foundations of Computing Science provides an intensive course of
lectures on the Mathematical Foundations of Computing. It has run annually
since 1999, and is hosted by the Universites of Birmingham, Leicester, and
Nottingham in rotation. The lectures are aimed at PhD students, typically in
their first or second year of study. However, the school is open to anyone who
is interested in learning more about the mathematical foundations of
computing, and all such participants are warmly welcomed. We also very much
welcome students from abroad.
