<h2>Sunday evening: Welcome</h2>
Eike and Achim will be at the Etap Hotel from 6pm onwards. At around
7:30 we will make our way to <i>The Green Room</i> for a drink and/or
some food. If you arrive late and you want to join us there, then
follow the directions in the <i>Restaurant Guide</i> to the
<a href="restaurant-list.html"><i>Arcardian area</i></a>.

<h2>Monday evening: Reception</h2>
Everyone is invited to a <i>Cheese and Wine</i> reception in the
Computer Science building after the last talk of the day. There will
probably not be enough food to substitute for a proper dinner, nor enough
drink to substitute for good soaking, but it'll give you a head-start
on both.

<h2>Tuesday evening: City tour</h2>
Achim will meet you in the lobby of the Etap Hotel at 7pm. The plan is
to have dinner at <i>Chez Jules</i> and then explore the
<i>Brindley Place</i> and <i>Broad Street</i> areas of the city. 

<h2>Wednesday lunch: Speakers' lunch</h2>
There will be a lunch for the speakers only on Wednesday
lunchtime. Details will be announced separately.

<h2>Thursday evening: Conference dinner</h2>
The conference dinner is for everyone and the cost for this was
included in your registration fee. It will take place in a restaurant
called <i>Pasta di Piazza</i> which is located in <i>11 Brook
  Street</i>, just off <i>St Paul's Square</i>, in the historic
<i>Jewelry Quarter</i>. If the weather is pleasant enough, we can walk
together from the Etap Hotel, leaving at 6:30. Otherwise, or if it's
too far for you (about 1.5miles) then you could share a taxi. Arrival
at the restaurant is scheduled for 7pm.

<p>A certain amount of wine will be available at the table but everything
beyond that has to be paid for in cash. </p>
