  	      I took this Thu-Fri off to be with my 11-year son in his school half term. Today he wanted to program the game 2048. I thought "oh no" - I wanted to go for a walk in such a nice weather. But it was 8 hours of great fun with two laptops in the garden. 1/

  	      Initial discussion. I don't know this game. Explain it to me. I got lot of examples. After a lot of discussion, I got more and more precise general rules from him. It is interesting to see how young people go from examples to general rules by trial and error.  2/

  	      The game is highly symmetric. The functional representation allowed us to do rotations and mirroring very easily. Then it was obvious to him that e.g. rotating clockwise once is the same as rotating three times anticlockwise. This gave shortcuts. 4/

  	      It should be fun to implement the discussions we had about this game, not only the game itself, it Agda or Lean or Coq etc. and see if kids could make sense of them. For example, could they at least understand the types of the claims?

  	      It is sad that when we reason about a problem and come up with a program to solve it, the reasoning doesn't get recorded in the program itself. It is precisely this that Agda, Lean, Coq etc. allows us to do if we want to.
