  	      My personal assessment is that 9.1% of the voters/observers seem to be fairly familiar with both the mathematics and the computer science communities (without claiming that they are necessarily farily familiar with mathematics and/or computer science). I have nothing else to say.

  	      Assuming that my twitter acquaintances will vote for computer science if they are mathematicians, and for mathematics if they are computer scientists, this can be considered to be a poll asking "which one are you"? But only if both are ideological in equal measure.
