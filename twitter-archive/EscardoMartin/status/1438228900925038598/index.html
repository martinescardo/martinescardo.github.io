  	      @jonmsterling Or even of more general kinds for which this still the case. Guess: a candidate for a counter-example is the topology of the Baire space. This is not a continuous dcpo. 2/

  	      @jonmsterling This space is actually as non-locally-compact as you can get: every compact set has empty interior. But it is simple enough to understand concretely. So its topology, regarded as a dcpo, is also as non-continuous as you can get. 4/4
