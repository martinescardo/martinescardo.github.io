  	      @JDHamkins But then we can try to see how far we can get. In fact, for a few years I have been investigating certain "searchable sets" in constructive mathematics, which satisfy a choice principle (by definition).<br>2/

  	      @JDHamkins I can build plenty of them, and, as you asked, they are well-ordered. And more, I use these well-orders to measure the complexity of the searchable sets we can get. <br>3/

  	      @JDHamkins Even more, these sets are not only searchable, but also every complemented subset is empty or else has a least element. Which is true classically of all ordered sets, but   fails in general constructively. It doesn't fail for the searchable sets. <br>4/
