  	      I blame both Hilbert and Brower, and many others, for this misunderstanding. Of course, both made great, long lasting, constributions. The battle was not won by Hilbert or by Brouwer. It was lost by both. Luckily, constructive mathematics survived. 2/2

  	      Sadly, very few people really understand what it amounts to and how it works.

  	      Both Hilbert and Brouwer preached about mathematics "as it should be" rather than "as it is actually practised". The richness of mathematics as it is actually practised is hardly captured by one view or the other<br>.
