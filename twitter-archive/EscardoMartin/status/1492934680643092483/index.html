  	      @joshuagrochow @plt_amy Then Grothendieck toposes were generalized to "elementary toposes", which include "realizability toposes", based on computation. The idea of realizability, though, came before, with the work of Kleene, trying to understand intuitionistic logic computationally, which he did.

  	      @joshuagrochow @plt_amy ... intuitionistic / constructive mathematics.<br>So, you see, he even noticed explicitly that there isn't just one flavour of constructive mathematics, by considering two models that modelled what different people were saying / axiomatizing / assuming / defending.
