  	      @JDHamkins Also, you are disconsidering situations in which a theorem in constructive mathematics doesn't have a counterpart in classical mathematics, because it is just an axiom there. Here is an example:

  	      @JDHamkins Say that a set X is exhaustible if for every p:X-&gt;2, either p(x)=0 for some X or else p(x)=1 for all X. All sets are exhaustible in classical mathematics.<br>2/

  	      @JDHamkins But we can't prove all sets to be exhaustible in constructive mathematics, as is well-known (meta-mathematically). However, the set of decreasing binary sequences is exhaustible. This theorem doesn't arise from analysing constraints.

  	      @JDHamkins Just mathematics as usual. We have problem, we don't know the answer and we try to find it. By intuition, by formal reasoning, blackboards, pencil and paper, and all tools the normal (classical or constructive) mathematician have at their hands.

  	      @JDHamkins Now we may interpret these results *beyond* the intuitive realm, and consider models of our results. I like Johnstone's topological topos. Magic: the set of decreasing binary sequences is the one-point compactification of the natural numbers.

  	      @JDHamkins Ha! So maybe exhaustibility has something do to with compactness. And it does! If we can prove a set to be exhaustible, then in the topological topos it is interpreted as a compact space.

  	      @JDHamkins And this is just the beginning of the story, in which we find more and more by making connections, via constructive mathematics, with diverse mathematical objects created by classical mathematicians. All this web of ideas is invisible in classical mathematics without such lenses.
