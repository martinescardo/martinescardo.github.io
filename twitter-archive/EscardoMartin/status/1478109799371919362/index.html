  	      Similarly, I wish there was a more or less general proof assistant that allowed me to define and confine myself to a precise language. For example, although a number of proof assistants are based on MLTT, none of them allow to confine oneself to (a precise fragment of) MLTT.

  	      It seems that people who design and implement proof assistants choose a type theory on behalf of their users. But if I want to prove things about 1-toposes with NNO, for example, no proof assistant will support that at present. And this is just one example.
