  	      Some theorems are obvious to students and some theorems seem too abstract to them, even if the proofs of the abstract theorems are shorter.  Random example:<br>(1) The pigeonhole principle.<br>(2) Every compact subset of a Hausdorff space is closed.

  	      What makes some facts, such as (1), be easy to "see" and difficult to justify rigorously?<br>Notice and (1) and (2) are just examples of the more general phenomenon I am interested in.

  	      Is (1) really obvious, or are we deceived by practical experience (with abstract things such as numbers and concrete things such as pigeons and holes and placements of pigeons into holes)?

  	      (In computer science, an analogue of the pigeonhole principle is substitution in the presence of bound variables. Isn't it obvious how this should work? Yet a 1000 or more papers have been written about this, and still people have trouble implementing it.)

  	      Maybe I should invite people to write down the shortest and clearest proofs of (1) and (2) they can came up with. But I stress that I am not interested in the particular examples (1) and (2) I considered above for the discussion I proposed.
