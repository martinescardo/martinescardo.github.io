  	      @XenaProject @roger_witte @jonmsterling @LawrPaulson I want to emphasize something that has been said twice already in this thread: constructivISM (a philosophy, a foundations) is rather different from constructive mathematics. I practice both classical and constructive mathematics, and there is no contradiction.<br>2/

  	      @XenaProject @roger_witte @jonmsterling @LawrPaulson My most recent paper, in the journal of Homotopy and Related Structures, uses both *classical* mathematics and HoTT/UF to prove something about homotopy types (the Cantor-Bernstein Theorem for them). It is something previously unknown and not obvious.<br>3/3
