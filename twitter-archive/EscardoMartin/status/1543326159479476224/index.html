  	      @freekwiedijk @valeriadepaiva So in the body of the paper, you should help your reader by flagging what is routine but needs proof, and also what is an insight that makes the paper worth publishing. This cannot be done in the abstract or the introduction. And doing it in the conclusion is probably not helpful
